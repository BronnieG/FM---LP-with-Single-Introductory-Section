## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have become much more confiden with CSS grid and am ready to try more difficult challenges. I still need to learn a bit more about how to manipulate images and when to use them as an image and when to use them as a background.

My ability to make the site mobile responsive was also quicker as I am getting used to the settings available to me.

### Continued development

I need to become more familair with the alinment properties so that I dont need to reference material all the time for this.
I also need to become more familiar with image properties.
